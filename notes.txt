NOTES ON GO -- THE LANGUAGE

website: http://golang.org
http://blog.golang.org/

-Created by Rob Pike, Ken Thompson (and Russ Cox)
- Imperative, statically typed language
- Semicolons after braces
- Scala like declaration -- type follows variable name
- Supports UTF-8 natively
- 6g compiler for 64 bit, 8-g compiler for 32 bit. History from Plan 9.
- Initializing declaration with :=
- gccgo -- requires you to build the entire gcc with go enabled.
- for is the only looping construct
- runtime parallelism is not enabled by default in 6g. need to enable it
  explicitly by setting environment variable GOMAXPROCS or import
  runtime package and call runtime.GOMAXPROCS(NCPU).
